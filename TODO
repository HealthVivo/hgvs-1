Actionable issues are at https://bitbucket.org/invitae/hgvs/issues.
This file is intended for ideas that need fleshing out.

* class restructuring
current: intervalmapper, transcriptmapper, hgvsmapper, projector, validator
proposed: hgvsmapper -> variantmapper, hgvsposition -> position


* clean/standardize naming
** Strive for this:
- hgvs{,_g,_c,_p} -- string
- var{,_g,_c,_p} -- variant
- ival -- interval
- location stuff: interval, position, location, pos, loc, start/end v. start/stop, posedit

- location-ish stuff -- everywhere


* move intrinsic validation to posedits (and recurse)


* small stuff
set_uncertain -> _set_uncertain (make internal)
