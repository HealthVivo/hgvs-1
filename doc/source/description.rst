Genome, transcript, and protein sequence variants are typically reported
using the `"HGVS Mutnomen recommendations"
<http://www.hgvs.org/mutnomen/>`_ provided by the `Human Genome Variation
Society (HGVS) <http://www.hgvs.org/>`_. The complexity of this standard
makes it difficult to use in software.

This package, ``hgvs``, is an easy-to-use Python library for parsing,
representing, formatting, and mapping variants between genome, transcript,
and protein sequences.  The current implementation handles most (but not
all) of the standard for precisely defined sequence variants.
