Getting Help
------------

There are several ways to get help with the ``hgvs`` package.

The `hgvs-discuss mailing list
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hgvs-discuss>`_ is the preferred
way to reach the ``hgvs`` package authors.  Please file bugs and feature
requests on the `hgvs issue tracker
<https://bitbucket.org/invitae/hgvs/issues?status=new&status=open>`_.

If you have questions about the `HGVS Mutation Nomenclature
<http://www.hgvs.org/mutnomen/>`_, consider posting your questions to the
`HGVS Facebook page <https://www.facebook.com/HGVSmutnomen>`_.
